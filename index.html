  <h1>The Web</h1>
  <p>The world wide web is a collection of html documents.
Hyperlinks link the pages together.  The world wide web was
Invented in the 1990's and is made up of over 30 billion pages</p>
<h2>Major Pieces</h2>
<p>The major components of the world wide web are the individual surfing the web, computers, internet  and servers.</p>
<p>Browsers make a request via the internet to servers using http.  Servers respond via the internet with files that your browser displays on your computer.</p>
<p>Examples of browsers are IE, Google Chrome and Firefox.</p>
<p>Servers are computers that are optimized and serving files.</p>
<p>Http is a very simple protocol that your browser uses to communicate with the servers.</p>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML documents are the heart of the web.  HTML is made up of tags.  We use markup to make the content look the way we want it to look.  There is an opening tag followed by content followed by a closing tag.  The whole thing is referred to as an element (opening tag - content - closing tag)</p>
<p>examples of tags are the following:<br>
  <b>b tag which makes items bold</b><br>
  <em>em tag which makes things italicized</em><br>
  br tag which creates a new line<br>
  a tag which is used to create links.  The a tag is an example of a tag that uses attributes and has content. A full example of an a tag is <a href="www.reddit.com"></a>"link</a>"<br>
  img tag which is used to insert images. Image tags do not have a closing tag because they do not have content.  They are considered void tags.<br>
  </p>
  <p>/When we put multiple spaces inbetween characters/words or multiple blank lines in the html document without using and html tag such as br to do so, this is called white space.  White space is interpreted as one single space, no matter how many spaces you enter. In order to get text to move to the next line we use the br or p tags</p>
  <h2>Inline/Block</h2>
  <p>Some elements are considered inline elements and some elements are considered block elements.  Block elements create and invisible box around the element and contain content.</p>
  <p>Examples of inline elements are a, span, br, img, strong</p>
  <p>Examples of block elements are div, p, form</p>
  <h2>HTML Document Structure</h2>
  <p>The document type tells us what type of document it is.  With HTML 5 this simpler that it used to be.  The html tags are the opening and closing tags that surround the document.  The head tag contains the metadata.  The tile tag contatins the title of thepage and the body tag contains the document.  In this course our main focus will be on the body.</p>
